Computing intersections of B-spline curves and surfaces.

Library focus on fast intersection algorithms for non-degenerate intersections of B-spline curves and surfaces
of small degree (especially quadratic). 

Requirements
------------

* g++ 4.x or newer
* cmake 3.x

In order to install BIH package locally for development just run the 'bih_install.sh' script.
